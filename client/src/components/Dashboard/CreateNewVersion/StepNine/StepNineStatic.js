			<h3>Create a Vision Board of goals and dreams.</h3>
			<p>
				There is a plenty of proof of how beneficial it is to have a clear set
				of goals and plans as they can provide a sense of direction and meaning.
				A vision board helps you to do just that and can bring hope and clarity
				when things may not seem to going your way. It is a great reminder of
				what is possible when we strive to do better, when we are working
				towards something, and always keep in mind that the journey alone is a
				large and very beneficial part of the process of achieving your goal.
			</p>
			<p>
				What can the rest of your life look like from today? Do you want to lose
				your weight, stop smoking, be happier, move to a new place?
			</p>
			<p>
				<strong>Start with your vision board for the next 5 years.</strong>
			</p>
