				With the continuous use of this tool combined with time spent on
				analyzing why and how things happen and how to best deal with them,
				answers begin to form for many of the things you are trying to solve or
				deal with. This section is also where you can keep track of the things
				you learn about yourself and others. This helps to reinforce the
				positive things you have done and also servers as a reminder of where
				you were at and how much better things can become when you seek
				solutions to the things that bother you or are negatively affecting you.
