			<h3>Practice Gratitude and Faith.</h3>
			<p>
				The benefits of practicing gratitude have been clearly proven, as well
				as the belief in a higher power or something bigger than us. When things
				seem like they are very gloomy, remembering some of the things that are
				right or how well some of the other areas of your life may be can have a
				great impact on your well being and attitude. It's a great way to put
				faith into practice, with the belief in good things to come, and in
				what's in store for us, and the reality is that most things always have
				a way of working out.
