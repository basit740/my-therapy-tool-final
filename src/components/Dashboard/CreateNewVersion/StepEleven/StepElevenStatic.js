				In this section, you can keep track of tangible changes and outcomes
				that have come about as a result of this process of figuring out how you
				can function better. Whether less stressed, more optimistic, or more
				focused, keeping track of the benefits gained becomes a valuable
				exercise in the process of achieving healing and well-being. It can be
				like an assessment tool as it enables you to monitor as well as being
				able to determine patterns and predict trends, behaviors, and outcomes
				for yourself.
